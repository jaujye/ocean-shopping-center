# PRD: Ocean Shopping Center

## Executive Summary

The Ocean Shopping Center is a comprehensive e-commerce and logistics management system designed to integrate online shopping with physical mall operations. This full-stack application serves three distinct user groups (customers, store tenants, and mall administrators) through a unified backend system with role-specific user interfaces. Built with modern web technologies and designed for high-concurrency traffic, this system provides end-to-end shopping, logistics tracking, and management capabilities.

The system features ocean-themed UI/UX design, real-time WebSocket communications, advanced product recommendations, and integrated logistics management with third-party APIs. Success is measured by complete frontend UI implementation, successful backend API integration, and successful Docker deployment.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Traditional shopping centers lack integrated digital platforms that seamlessly connect online shopping experiences with physical mall operations. Current systems often operate in silos, creating fragmented experiences for customers, inefficient management for store tenants, and limited oversight for mall administrators.

**Why is this important now?**
- Post-pandemic shopping behaviors demand hybrid online-offline experiences
- Rising customer expectations for real-time logistics tracking and personalized recommendations
- Mall operators need comprehensive tools to manage multi-tenant environments
- Store owners require advanced analytics and direct customer communication channels
- High-traffic e-commerce requires scalable, high-performance architecture
