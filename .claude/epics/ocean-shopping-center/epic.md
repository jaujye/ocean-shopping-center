# Epic: Ocean Shopping Center

## Overview

A comprehensive e-commerce and logistics management platform integrating online shopping with physical mall operations. Features multi-role architecture (customers, store tenants, administrators) with unified Spring Boot backend, React frontend, real-time WebSocket communications, and containerized deployment supporting 10,000+ concurrent users.

## Architecture Decisions

**Single Backend, Multi-Frontend Strategy:**
- Unified Spring Boot backend serving role-specific React interfaces
- JWT authentication with Redis session management and RBAC
- WebSocket integration for real-time notifications across all roles

**Technology Stack Selection:**
- **React + Tailwind CSS:** Rapid development with ocean-themed design system, component reusability
- **Spring Boot:** Enterprise security, WebSocket support, comprehensive ecosystem
- **PostgreSQL:** ACID transactions, advanced indexing for product search and analytics
- **Redis:** High-performance caching, session storage, real-time data management

**Integration Strategy:**
- MCP tool integration for development workflow optimization
- Third-party logistics API abstraction layer for multi-carrier support
- Event-driven architecture for scalable real-time communications

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Shared Design System:**
- Ocean-themed Tailwind CSS components with consistent branding
- Reusable components: ProductCard, SearchFilter, Cart, Dashboard, Chat
- Responsive design patterns for desktop and mobile
- Role-based navigation and access control

**User Interface Specialization:**
- Customer UI: Product discovery, cart management, order tracking, live chat
- Store Owner UI: Inventory management, sales analytics, customer communication
- Administrator UI: System oversight, tenant management, platform analytics

**State Management:**
- React Context for authentication and role management
- Component-level state for UI interactions
- WebSocket event handling for real-time updates

### Backend Services

**API Architecture:**
- RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
- WebSocket handlers for real-time communication
- Role-based endpoint access control
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Core Service Modules:**
- Authentication & Authorization Service
- Product Catalog & Search Service
- Order Processing & Payment Service
- Logistics & Tracking Integration Service
- Real-time Communication Service
- Analytics & Reporting Service

**Data Layer:**
- JPA repositories with custom queries for complex operations
- Database connection pooling for high concurrency
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Audit logging for compliance and debugging

### Infrastructure

**Containerization:**
- Multi-container Docker setup with service isolation
- Docker Compose for development environment
- Environment-specific configuration management

**Performance Optimization:**
- Database indexing strategy for search and analytics
- Redis caching for session management and frequent queries
- Connection pooling and async processing
- CDN integration for static asset delivery

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Audit logging for security compliance
- Health checks for container orchestration

## Implementation Strategy

**Development Phases:**
1. **Foundation (Week 1-2):** Database setup, Spring Boot configuration, React project structure
2. **Core Features (Week 3-4):** Authentication, product management, basic UI for all roles
3. **Advanced Features (Week 5-6):** WebSocket implementation, logistics integration, analytics
4. **Deployment & Testing (Week 7-8):** Containerization, performance testing, production deployment

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Early prototype of WebSocket architecture to validate real-time requirements
- Incremental third-party API integration with fallback mechanisms
- Load testing throughout development to ensure concurrency targets
- Security review at each phase to maintain compliance

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for business logic with 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests for API endpoints and external services
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Performance testing for concurrency and response time requirements
