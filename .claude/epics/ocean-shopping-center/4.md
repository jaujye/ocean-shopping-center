# Task: Authentication and Authorization System

## Description
Implement comprehensive JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control (RBAC) for three user types: customers, store owners, and administrators. Include user registration, login, session management with Redis, and security middleware for API protection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User registration endpoints for all three roles
- [ ] Login endpoint with JWT token generation
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism implemented
- [ ] Role-based access control middleware functional
- [ ] Password encryption and secure storage
- [ ] Session management with Redis integration
- [ ] Logout functionality with token invalidation
- [ ] Protected API endpoints based on user roles
- [ ] User profile management endpoints

## Technical Details
- **Authentication Components:**
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - Refresh token mechanism
  - Password encoding with BCrypt
  - Security filter chain configuration
- **User Roles:**
  - ROLE_CUSTOMER - Basic shopping access
  - ROLE_STORE_OWNER - Store management access
  - ROLE_ADMIN - System administration access
- **API Endpoints:**
  - POST `/api/auth/register` - User registration
  - POST `/api/auth/login` - User login
  - POST `/api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
  - POST `/api/auth/logout` - User logout
  - GET `/api/user/profile` - Get user profile
  - PUT `/api/user/profile` - Update user profile
- **Security Configuration:**
  - CORS configuration for frontend access
  - CSRF protection where appropriate
  - Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 completed (Spring Boot foundation ready)
- [ ] Database schema includes user tables
- [ ] Redis configured for session storage

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 48
- Parallel: false (critical path item)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication endpoints functional
- [ ] JWT tokens successfully generated and validated
- [ ] Role-based access control tested for all roles
- [ ] Session management working with Redis
- [ ] Security tests written and passing
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flow
