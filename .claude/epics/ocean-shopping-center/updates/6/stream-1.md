## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Product CRUD APIs** - Full create, read, update, delete operations with role-based security
2. **Advanced Search** - Full-text search across name, description, SKU with multiple filters
3. **Filtering System** - Category, price range, stock status, featured, digital, discount filters
4. **Sorting & Pagination** - Sortable by name, price, date, rating, popularity with pagination
5. **Inventory Management** - Stock tracking, low stock alerts, availability checks
6. **Basic Recommendations** - Algorithm based on popularity and featured products
7. **Security Integration** - Role-based access control with @PreAuthorize annotations

### API Endpoints Created
- `GET /api/products` - List products with filtering/search/pagination
- `GET /api/products/{id}` - Get product by ID with full details
- `GET /api/products/store/{storeId}/slug/{slug}` - Get by slug and store
- `GET /api/products/search` - Advanced product search
- `GET /api/products/featured` - Get featured products
- `GET /api/products/recommendations` - Personalized recommendations
- `GET /api/products/{id}/related` - Related products
- `GET /api/products/store/{storeId}` - Products by store
- `GET /api/products/category/{categoryId}` - Products by category
- `POST /api/products` - Create product (Store Owner/Admin)
- `PUT /api/products/{id}` - Update product (Store Owner/Admin)
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}` - Soft delete product (Store Owner/Admin)
- `GET /api/products/{id}/availability` - Check stock availability
- `GET /api/products/low-stock` - Low stock products (Authenticated)

### Database Integration
- Advanced JPA repository with custom queries and specifications
- Optimized indexes for search performance
- Support for complex filtering combinations
- Efficient pagination with sorting

### Testing Coverage
- **ProductService**: 25+ test scenarios covering CRUD, search, validation, edge cases
- **ProductController**: 20+ test scenarios covering all endpoints, security, error handling
- Full mocking with Mockito and comprehensive assertions with AssertJ
