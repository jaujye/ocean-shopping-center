# Stream 2: Frontend Product Management (Store Owner)

## Scope
Store owner product management interface with product creation, editing, listing, image management, and inventory control.

## Files

- frontend/src/components/products/ProductList.tsx
- frontend/src/components/products/ImageUploader.tsx
- frontend/src/services/productService.ts
- frontend/src/hooks/useProducts.ts
- frontend/src/types/product.ts

## Progress
### Completed âœ…
- Created comprehensive product types in `frontend/src/types/product.ts` with interfaces for:
  - ProductFilters, ProductFormData, ProductValidationErrors
  - ProductCategory, ProductStats, InventoryUpdate, ProductSearchResult
  - BulkAction types for product operations
- Implemented `frontend/src/services/productService.ts` with full API integration:
  - CRUD operations for products
  - Advanced filtering and search
  - Bulk operations (activate/deactivate/delete/update)
  - File upload for product images
  - Inventory management
  - Product statistics and reporting
  - CSV import/export functionality
- Created `frontend/src/hooks/useProducts.ts` custom hook for state management:
  - Product fetching with filters and pagination
  - CRUD operations with optimistic updates
  - Selection management for bulk operations
  - Error handling and loading states
- Built `frontend/src/components/products/ImageUploader.tsx` component:
  - Drag and drop image uploads
  - Multiple image support with preview
  - Upload progress tracking
  - Error handling and retry functionality
  - Image validation (file type, size limits)
- Developed `frontend/src/components/products/ProductForm.tsx`:
  - Comprehensive product creation/editing form
  - Form validation with react-hook-form
  - Dynamic category/subcategory selection
  - Pricing with discount support
  - Specifications management
  - Integration with ImageUploader
- Created `frontend/src/components/products/ProductList.tsx`:
  - Grid and list view modes
  - Advanced filtering and search
  - Bulk selection and operations
  - Sorting and pagination
  - Product actions menu (edit, duplicate, delete)
- Implemented `frontend/src/pages/store/ProductManagement.tsx` main page:
  - Dashboard with statistics overview
  - Stock alerts and notifications
  - Integrated all product components
  - State management and error handling

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- Fixing TypeScript compilation issues:
  - Button component type issues
  - Import path corrections
  - TailwindCSS PostCSS configuration
  - Module resolution problems

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive interfaces
- **State Management**: Custom hooks with optimistic updates and error handling  
- **API Integration**: Complete service layer with proper error handling
- **User Experience**: Loading states, notifications, and responsive design
- **File Management**: Image upload with progress tracking and validation
- **Bulk Operations**: Selection-based actions for multiple products
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with validation and error display

### Architecture Decisions
- Separated types into product-specific module for better organization
- Used custom hooks for reusable state logic
- Implemented service layer pattern for API calls
- Component composition for flexible UI layouts
- Error boundaries and graceful error handling

### Known Issues
1. TailwindCSS PostCSS configuration conflicts
2. Some TypeScript module resolution issues
3. React Hook Form types need adjustment
4. Button component needs type fixes

### Next Steps
1. Resolve compilation issues
2. Test component integration
3. Add missing dependencies
4. Verify API endpoint compatibility
