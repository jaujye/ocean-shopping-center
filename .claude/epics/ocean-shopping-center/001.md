# Task: Infrastructure and Database Setup

## Description
Set up the foundational infrastructure including PostgreSQL database schema, Redis configuration for caching and session management, Docker environment setup, and MCP tool integration. This establishes the core data layer and development environment for the Ocean Shopping Center platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL database schema created with all required tables (users, products, orders, stores, shipping, communications)
- [ ] Database indexes optimized for search and high-concurrency operations
- [ ] Redis server configured for session storage and caching
- [ ] Docker Compose setup with all required services (frontend, backend, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [ ] MCP tools integrated and tested (Context7, graphiti_ocean-shopping-center, Postgres, Redis)
- [ ] Environment configuration files created for development and production

## Technical Details
- **Database Schema:**
  - Users table with role-based fields (customer, store_owner, administrator)
  - Products table with search-optimized indexing
  - Orders table with status tracking
  - Stores table for tenant management
  - Shipping table for logistics tracking
  - Communications table for chat messages
- **Redis Configuration:**
  - Session storage with TTL management
  - Cache keys for product catalog and user data
  - Connection pooling setup
- **Docker Setup:**
  - Multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose
  - Volume mapping for persistent data
  - Network configuration for service communication

## Dependencies
- [ ] PostgreSQL server installed or accessible
- [ ] Redis server installed or accessible
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose installed
- [ ] MCP tools available and configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40
- Parallel: true (can start immediately)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database schema implemented and migrations created
- [ ] Redis configuration tested with sample operations
- [ ] Docker Compose successfully starts all services
- [ ] MCP tools successfully connected and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Environment variables documented
