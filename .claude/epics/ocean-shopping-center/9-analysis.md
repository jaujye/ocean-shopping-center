- Network configuration: ‚úÖ Custom bridge network (172.20.0.0/16)
- Volume management: ‚úÖ Persistent volumes for data
- Health checks: ‚úÖ Database and Redis health monitoring
```

### Required Docker Enhancements

#### 1. Backend Dockerfile (Multi-stage Build)
```dockerfile
# Target: Optimized JRE 17 container with Spring Boot
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /workspace/app
COPY mvnw .
COPY .mvn .mvn
COPY pom.xml .
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline
COPY src src
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /workspace/app/target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-XX:+UseContainerSupport", "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

#### 2. Frontend Dockerfile (Nginx-based)
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
    CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost || exit 1
```

## Load Testing Strategy

### Testing Framework Selection
**Recommended:** K6 for JavaScript-based load testing

```javascript
// Load Testing Scenarios
export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },   // Ramp up
    { duration: '10m', target: 1000 }, // Stay at 1K users
    { duration: '5m', target: 5000 },  // Ramp to 5K users
    { duration: '10m', target: 10000 }, // Peak load 10K users
    { duration: '5m', target: 0 },     // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<200'], // 95% under 200ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],    // Error rate under 10%
  },
};
```

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **User Authentication Flow**: Login, JWT refresh, logout
2. **Product Browsing**: Catalog search, product details, filtering
3. **Shopping Cart Operations**: Add items, modify quantities, checkout
4. **Order Processing**: Payment flow, order confirmation, tracking
5. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections, chat functionality
