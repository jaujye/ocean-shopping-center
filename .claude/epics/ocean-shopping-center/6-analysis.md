# Analysis: Product Management System

## Overview
Large-scale implementation of complete product catalog management system with both backend APIs and frontend interfaces. Requires comprehensive CRUD operations, search functionality, recommendation engine, and multimedia support.

## Dependencies Check
- ✅ Task 3: Backend foundation (Spring Boot) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Task 4: Authentication system - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Database schema includes product tables - COMPLETED

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream 1: Backend API Foundation
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Estimated**: 20 hours  
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)  
**Scope**: Core product management APIs and data layer

**Files to create/modify:**
- `backend/src/main/java/com/ocean/shopping/controller/ProductController.java`
- `backend/src/main/java/com/ocean/shopping/service/ProductService.java` 
- `backend/src/main/java/com/ocean/shopping/repository/ProductRepository.java`
- `backend/src/main/java/com/ocean/shopping/dto/product/ProductRequest.java`
- `backend/src/main/java/com/ocean/shopping/dto/product/ProductResponse.java`
- `backend/src/main/java/com/ocean/shopping/dto/product/ProductFilter.java`

**Implementation details:**
- Product CRUD APIs with proper validation
- Advanced search with filters (category, price, popularity)
- Product recommendation basic algorithm
- Image upload endpoints
- Review and rating APIs
- Pagination and sorting

### Stream 2: Frontend Product Management (Store Owner)
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Estimated**: 18 hours  
**Dependencies**: Stream 1 APIs (can start with mock data)  
**Scope**: Store owner product management interface

**Files to create/modify:**
- `frontend/src/pages/store/ProductManagement.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/products/ProductForm.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/products/ProductList.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/products/ImageUploader.tsx`
- `frontend/src/services/productService.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProducts.ts`

**Implementation details:**
- Product creation and editing forms
- Product list with search and filters
- Image upload and management
- Bulk operations
- Inventory management

### Stream 3: Frontend Customer Experience
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Estimated**: 18 hours  
**Dependencies**: Stream 1 APIs (can start with mock data)  
**Scope**: Customer-facing product browsing and shopping

**Files to create/modify:**
- `frontend/src/pages/products/ProductCatalog.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/products/ProductDetail.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/products/ProductGrid.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/products/ProductFilters.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/cart/CartDrawer.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/products/ProductReviews.tsx`
- `frontend/src/services/cartService.ts`

**Implementation details:**
- Product catalog with advanced filtering
- Product detail pages with gallery
- Shopping cart functionality
- Wishlist feature
- Product reviews and ratings display
- Recommendation display

## Coordination Strategy

1. **Stream 1** starts immediately and provides API contracts
2. **Streams 2 & 3** can start in parallel using mock data/TypeScript interfaces
3. Integration happens when Stream 1 APIs are ready
4. All streams coordinate through shared TypeScript interfaces

## Risk Mitigation

- Frontend streams start with mock data to avoid blocking
- API contracts defined early for frontend development
- Progressive integration as backend APIs become available
- Shared interfaces ensure type safety across streams

## Success Criteria

- All acceptance criteria met
- Performance optimized for large catalogs  
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Proper error handling and loading states
