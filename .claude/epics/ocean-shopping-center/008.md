# Task: Deployment and Performance Optimization

## Description
Containerize the entire application with Docker, optimize performance for high-concurrency requirements, implement monitoring and logging, and prepare for production deployment. Conduct comprehensive testing including load testing, security testing, and cross-browser compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker images created for all services
- [ ] Docker Compose orchestration configured
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations managed
- [ ] Database query optimization completed
- [ ] Redis caching strategy implemented
- [ ] CDN integration for static assets
- [ ] Load testing achieving 10,000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Production deployment guide created

## Technical Details
- **Docker Configuration:**
  - Multi-stage builds for optimized images
  - Frontend: nginx-based React container
  - Backend: JRE-based Spring Boot container
  - PostgreSQL with volume persistence
  - Redis with appropriate memory limits
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Database indexing and query optimization
  - Connection pooling configuration
  - Async processing for heavy operations
  - Frontend code splitting and lazy loading
  - Image optimization and CDN delivery
  - API response caching strategies
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Unit test coverage >80%
  - Integration tests for all APIs
  - End-to-end tests for user journeys
  - Load testing with JMeter or K6
  - Security scanning with OWASP tools
  - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Monitoring Setup:**
  - Application metrics collection
  - Log aggregation and analysis
  - Health check endpoints
  - Performance monitoring dashboards
  - Alert configuration for critical issues
- **Deployment Configuration:**
  - Environment variables management
  - Secrets management
  - SSL/TLS configuration
  - Reverse proxy setup
  - Auto-scaling configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks completed
- [ ] Production infrastructure available
- [ ] CDN service configured
- [ ] SSL certificates obtained
- [ ] Monitoring tools selected

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 48
- Parallel: false (final integration task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All services running in Docker containers
- [ ] Docker Compose working for local development
- [ ] Load testing shows 10,000+ concurrent users supported
- [ ] API response times consistently <200ms
- [ ] Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
- [ ] Deployment documentation complete
- [ ] Production deployment successful
