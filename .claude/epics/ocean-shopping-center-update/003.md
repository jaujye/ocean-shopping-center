## Description
Implement a robust Redis-based distributed lock core framework to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency across the Ocean Shopping Center's distributed architecture. This framework will provide lock management services, comprehensive monitoring systems, and exception recovery mechanisms to maintain system reliability under concurrent operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Redis distributed lock service implemented
- [ ] Lock acquisition and release mechanisms functional
- [ ] Deadlock prevention and detection implemented
- [ ] Lock timeout and auto-expiration configured
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard for lock statistics created
- [ ] Exception handling and recovery procedures established
- [ ] Lock performance metrics collected and analyzed
- [ ] High availability configuration implemented
- [ ] Load testing completed with satisfactory results

## Technical Details

### Core Lock Framework Components

#### Lock Manager Service
```typescript
interface DistributedLock {
  acquire(key: string, ttl?: number, retries?: number): Promise<string>;
  release(key: string, token: string): Promise<boolean>;
  extend(key: string, token: string, ttl: number): Promise<boolean>;
  isLocked(key: string): Promise<boolean>;
  getOwner(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
}
```

#### Lock Configuration
- **Default TTL**: 30 seconds
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms, ...)
- **Max Retries**: 5 attempts
- **Lock Keys Pattern**: `lock:{service}:{resource}:{id}`

#### Monitoring Metrics
- Lock acquisition time
- Lock hold duration
- Failed acquisition attempts
- Active lock count
- Lock timeout events
- System throughput impact

### Implementation Architecture

#### Redis Configuration
- Master-slave setup for high availability
- Persistence configuration (RDB + AOF)
- Memory optimization settings
- Connection pooling configuration

#### Exception Recovery Mechanisms
1. **Orphaned Lock Detection**: Identify and clean expired locks
2. **Network Partition Recovery**: Handle Redis connectivity issues  
3. **Application Crash Recovery**: Clean locks on service restart
4. **Lock Leak Prevention**: Automated cleanup procedures

#### Integration Points
- Shopping cart operations
- Inventory management updates
- Payment processing workflows
- User session management
- Cache invalidation processes

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (HTTPS Security Infrastructure) - Required for secure Redis connections
- Redis server setup and configuration
- Application logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Load balancing and service discovery systems

## Effort Estimate
- **Framework Design & Development**: 3 days
- **Redis Setup & Configuration**: 1 day
- **Monitoring System Implementation**: 2 days
- **Exception Handling & Recovery**: 2 days
- **Testing & Load Testing**: 2 days
- **Documentation & Integration**: 1 day
- **Total**: 11 days

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Redis distributed lock framework fully implemented
- [ ] Lock acquisition/release working reliably under load
- [ ] Deadlock prevention mechanisms verified
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard operational with real-time metrics
- [ ] Exception recovery procedures tested and documented
- [ ] High availability configuration validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 5ms lock operations)
- [ ] Load testing completed (1000+ concurrent operations)
- [ ] Security audit passed (encrypted connections via HTTPS infrastructure)
- [ ] Integration with existing services completed
- [ ] Operational runbooks created
- [ ] Alerting configured for lock system health
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures established

## Notes
This task depends on Task 001 (HTTPS Security Infrastructure) to ensure all Redis connections are properly secured. The distributed lock framework is critical for preventing race conditions in high-concurrency scenarios like flash sales, inventory updates, and payment processing. The framework must be thoroughly tested under load before production deployment.
