## Technical Details

### Architecture Components
```
Monitoring & Performance Architecture:
├── Metrics Collection (Prometheus + Custom metrics)
├── Visualization Layer (Grafana dashboards)
├── Alerting System (AlertManager + Slack/Email)
├── Log Aggregation (ELK Stack / Loki)
├── Distributed Tracing (Jaeger / Zipkin)
├── Performance Profiling (APM tools)
└── Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD + Blue-Green)
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Comprehensive Metrics Collection**
   - Application metrics (business KPIs, technical metrics)
   - Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
   - Database metrics (query performance, connection pools)
   - Cache metrics (hit ratios, memory usage, latency)
   - Custom business metrics (orders, payments, user activity)

2. **Advanced Monitoring Dashboards**
   - Executive dashboard with business KPIs
   - Technical dashboard with system health indicators
   - Performance dashboard with latency and throughput metrics
   - Security dashboard with threat detection and audit trails
   - Real-time alerting dashboard with incident management

3. **Performance Optimization Engine**
   - Automated query optimization recommendations
   - Cache warming strategies and preloading
   - Database connection pool optimization
   - API endpoint performance profiling
   - Frontend asset optimization and CDN integration

4. **Production-Ready Deployment**
   - Containerized deployment with health checks
   - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory/custom metrics
   - Load balancer configuration with health probes
   - SSL certificate management and rotation
   - Backup automation and recovery testing

### Monitoring Stack Configuration
```yaml
# Monitoring Stack Configuration
monitoring:
  prometheus:
    retention: "30d"
    scrape_interval: "15s"
    alert_rules: true
    
  grafana:
    dashboards: ["business", "technical", "performance", "security"]
    alerts: ["email", "slack", "pagerduty"]
    retention: "90d"
    
  logging:
    level: "info"
    format: "json"
    rotation: "daily"
    retention: "30d"
    
  tracing:
    sampling_rate: 0.1
    retention: "7d"
    services: ["api", "payment", "inventory"]
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```typescript
// Performance Targets
interface PerformanceTargets {
  api_response_time_p99: 200; // milliseconds
  database_query_time_p95: 100; // milliseconds
  cache_hit_ratio: 0.95; // 95%
  page_load_time: 2000; // milliseconds
  concurrent_users: 10000; // simultaneous users
  uptime_sla: 0.999; // 99.9% availability
}
```

### Dashboard Specifications
```typescript
// Grafana Dashboard Configuration
interface DashboardConfig {
  business_metrics: {
    panels: ["orders_per_hour", "revenue_tracking", "user_registrations"];
    refresh_rate: "30s";
  };
  
  technical_metrics: {
    panels: ["cpu_usage", "memory_usage", "disk_io", "network_traffic"];
    refresh_rate: "15s";
  };
  
  performance_metrics: {
    panels: ["response_times", "throughput", "error_rates", "cache_performance"];
    refresh_rate: "10s";
  };
  
  security_metrics: {
    panels: ["failed_logins", "ssl_cert_expiry", "security_events"];
    refresh_rate: "60s";
  };
}
```
