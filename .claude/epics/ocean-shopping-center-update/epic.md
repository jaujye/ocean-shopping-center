# Ocean Shopping Center Update Epic

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive upgrade of the Ocean Shopping Center platform focusing on security infrastructure, performance optimization, UI/UX improvements, and system reliability. This epic addresses critical areas including HTTPS implementation, unified icon systems, distributed locking mechanisms, MCP tools integration, and comprehensive monitoring infrastructure.

## Business Value

- **Enhanced Security**: HTTPS/SSL implementation ensuring secure user transactions and data protection
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized caching, distributed locks, and monitoring systems for better reliability
- **Better User Experience**: Unified icon system and responsive design improvements across all devices
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and MCP tools integration for development efficiency
- **System Scalability**: Production-ready infrastructure supporting high-concurrency operations

## Technical Overview

This epic encompasses a full-stack modernization of the Ocean Shopping Center platform with focus on:

1. **Security Layer**: HTTPS infrastructure with proper certificate management and security headers
2. **Frontend Enhancement**: Heroicons unified icon system for consistent visual language
3. **Backend Infrastructure**: Redis distributed locks for data consistency
4. **Developer Tools**: MCP integration for documentation, knowledge management, and database operations
5. **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and deployment pipelines

## Tasks Created

- [ ] #29 - HTTPS Security Infrastructure Upgrade (parallel: true)
- [ ] #30 - Heroicons Unified Icon System (parallel: true)
- [ ] #31 - Redis Distributed Lock Core Framework (parallel: false)
- [ ] #32 - MCP Tools Deep Integration (parallel: true)
- [ ] #33 - Monitoring and Performance Optimization (parallel: false)

Total tasks: 5
