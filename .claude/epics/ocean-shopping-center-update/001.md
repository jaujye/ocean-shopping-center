## Description
Implement comprehensive HTTPS/SSL infrastructure upgrade for the Ocean Shopping Center website to ensure secure communications, proper certificate management, and enhanced security headers. This foundational security layer will protect user data and establish trust through proper encryption protocols.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates properly configured and validated
- [ ] HTTP to HTTPS redirect functionality implemented
- [ ] Security headers configured (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Certificate auto-renewal system established
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration follows industry best practices
- [ ] All API endpoints secured with HTTPS
- [ ] Mixed content issues resolved
- [ ] Security testing passed (SSL Labs A+ rating)

## Technical Details

### Security Headers Implementation
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: Force HTTPS connections
- **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: Prevent XSS attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevent MIME sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Control referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Control browser features

### Certificate Management
- Implement automated certificate provisioning
- Set up certificate renewal monitoring
- Configure certificate validation checks
- Establish certificate backup procedures

### Configuration Updates
- Update server configuration files
- Modify application settings for HTTPS
- Update database connection strings if needed
- Configure load balancer SSL termination

## Dependencies
- Server access and configuration permissions
- Domain name and DNS management access
- Certificate authority integration
- Monitoring system setup

## Effort Estimate
- **Development**: 2-3 days
- **Testing**: 1 day
- **Deployment**: 0.5 day
- **Total**: 3.5-4.5 days

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All HTTP traffic automatically redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed and valid
- [ ] Security headers properly configured and tested
- [ ] Certificate auto-renewal system operational
- [ ] Security scan passes with A+ rating
- [ ] No mixed content warnings in browser
- [ ] All API endpoints accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] Documentation updated with security configuration
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for certificate expiry
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and optimized

## Notes
This task establishes the security foundation for the entire ocean-shopping-center-update epic. All subsequent tasks will benefit from the secure infrastructure implemented here.
