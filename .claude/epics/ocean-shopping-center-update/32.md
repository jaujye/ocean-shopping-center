## Description

Implement deep integration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to enhance development workflow, establish knowledge graph management, and automate operational tasks. This integration focuses on creating a comprehensive development assistance ecosystem using Context7 documentation querying, Graphiti knowledge management, PostgreSQL operations, and Redis tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Integration Requirements
- [ ] Context7 MCP tool integrated for real-time documentation access
- [ ] Graphiti knowledge graph system operational for project memory
- [ ] PostgreSQL MCP tools configured for database operations and optimization
- [ ] Redis MCP tools integrated for cache management and debugging
- [ ] IDE integration for enhanced development experience

### Knowledge Management System
- [ ] Automated capture of technical decisions and architectural choices
- [ ] Project knowledge graph maintained with entity relationships
- [ ] Development patterns and best practices documented in graph format
- [ ] Cross-reference system for code patterns and documentation

### Operational Automation
- [ ] Database query optimization recommendations through MCP tools
- [ ] Redis cache performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Automated technical documentation generation
- [ ] Development workflow efficiency metrics collection

## Technical Details

### Architecture Components
```
MCP Tools Integration Architecture:
├── Context7 Service (Documentation Query)
├── Graphiti Memory Service (Knowledge Graph)
├── PostgreSQL Operations Service (DB Tools)
├── Redis Management Service (Cache Tools)
└── IDE Integration Layer (VS Code/Claude Code)
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Context7 Documentation Integration**
   - Library documentation real-time querying
   - API reference integration into development workflow
   - Contextual help system for current development tasks
   - Documentation version tracking and updates

2. **Graphiti Knowledge Graph System**
   - Automatic capture of development episodes
   - Technical decision tracking and reasoning
   - Code pattern recognition and documentation
   - Project evolution timeline maintenance

3. **Database Operations Enhancement**
   - Query performance analysis and recommendations
   - Index optimization suggestions
   - Database health monitoring integration
   - Automated database documentation generation

4. **Redis Operations Toolkit**
   - Cache performance monitoring
   - Key pattern analysis and optimization
   - Memory usage tracking and alerts
   - Cache invalidation strategy optimization

### Service Integration Points
```typescript
// MCP Services Integration
interface MCPToolsService {
  context7: {
    queryDocumentation(library: string, topic?: string): Promise<Documentation>;
    searchAPI(query: string): Promise<APIReference[]>;
  };
  
  graphiti: {
    addMemory(episode: DevelopmentEpisode): Promise<void>;
    searchMemory(query: string): Promise<KnowledgeNode[]>;
    getProjectTimeline(): Promise<Timeline>;
  };
  
  postgresql: {
    analyzeQuery(sql: string): Promise<QueryAnalysis>;
    optimizeSchema(table: string): Promise<Optimization[]>;
    getHealthStatus(): Promise<DatabaseHealth>;
  };
  
  redis: {
    analyzeCachePatterns(): Promise<CacheAnalysis>;
    monitorPerformance(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>;
    optimizeMemoryUsage(): Promise<OptimizationReport>;
  };
}
```

### Integration Configuration
```yaml
# MCP Tools Configuration
mcp_tools:
  context7:
    endpoint: "context7://library-docs"
    libraries: ["react", "tailwindcss", "spring-boot", "postgresql"]
    auto_update: true
    
  graphiti:
    endpoint: "graphiti://ocean-shopping-center"
    group_id: "ocean-shopping-center-development"
    auto_capture: true
    
  postgresql:
    connection: "${DATABASE_URL}"
    monitoring: true
    optimization: true
    
  redis:
    connection: "${REDIS_URL}"  
    monitoring: true
    pattern_analysis: true
```

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
