## Description
Implement a comprehensive Heroicons-based unified icon system to replace inconsistent icon usage across the Ocean Shopping Center website. This system will provide consistent visual language, improved accessibility, better performance through optimized icon loading, and responsive adaptation across all device types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Heroicons library integrated into the project
- [ ] All existing icons replaced with appropriate Heroicons equivalents
- [ ] Icon component system created with consistent API
- [ ] Responsive icon sizing implemented
- [ ] Accessibility attributes added to all icons
- [ ] Icon loading optimized (tree-shaking, lazy loading)
- [ ] Dark/light theme support for icons
- [ ] Icon documentation and usage guidelines created
- [ ] Performance improvement measured and documented

## Technical Details

### Icon Component Architecture
```typescript
interface IconProps {
  name: string;
  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl';
  variant?: 'outline' | 'solid' | 'mini';
  className?: string;
  color?: string;
  'aria-label'?: string;
}
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Icon Inventory**: Audit all current icons and map to Heroicons
2. **Component Creation**: Build reusable icon components
3. **Optimization**: Implement tree-shaking for unused icons
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure icons scale properly across devices
5. **Accessibility**: Add proper ARIA labels and screen reader support

### Integration Points
- Navigation menus and buttons
- Form controls and inputs
- Status indicators and badges
- Cards and list items
- Modal dialogs and overlays
- Mobile responsive layouts

### Performance Optimizations
- Bundle size reduction through selective imports
- SVG optimization and compression
- Icon caching strategies
- Lazy loading for non-critical icons

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm/yarn package manager
- Build system configuration (Webpack/Vite/etc.)
- Design system documentation
- Accessibility testing tools

## Effort Estimate
- **Icon Audit & Mapping**: 0.5 day
- **Component Development**: 1.5 days
- **Integration & Replacement**: 2 days
- **Optimization & Testing**: 1 day
- **Documentation**: 0.5 day
- **Total**: 5.5 days

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Heroicons library successfully integrated
- [ ] All legacy icons replaced with Heroicons
- [ ] Icon component system functional and documented
- [ ] Responsive behavior verified on all screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Bundle size impact measured and optimized
- [ ] Performance metrics show improvement or no regression
- [ ] Dark/light theme variants working correctly
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Developer documentation updated with icon usage guidelines
- [ ] Design system updated with new icon standards
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Notes
This task runs in parallel with the security infrastructure upgrade as it focuses on frontend presentation layer improvements that don't depend on backend security changes. The unified icon system will provide consistency across the entire application and improve user experience.
